// The Advanced Civilization game engine: a GameAdapter for

// into:
//   - AUTO phases (taxation, population expansion, census, ship construction,
//     conflict, trade-card acquisition, trade, calamity, AST adjustment) which
//     the engine resolves deterministically with no player action, and
//   - INTERACTIVE phases (movement, city construction, acquire advances) where
//     each player in census order acts (possibly several actions) then `pass`es.
//
// After every applied action the state is "normalized": auto phases are run and
// completed interactive phases advanced, until the acting player is a human-
// decision point or the game is over. This keeps currentActor() always pointing
// at a real decision.
